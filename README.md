#  Spotify Clone – ICT Semester Project

Welcome to my **Spotify Clone** project!  
This was built as a semester project for the **Introduction to Information and Communication Technology** course. It's a basic front-end replica of Spotify, created using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.  
Since this was my **first ever website**, it may not be perfect — but it's a project I'm really proud of.

To run the project:

1. **Download or clone** the repository.
2. Simply **open `Page1.html` in your browser** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. That’s it — no setup or installation needed!
